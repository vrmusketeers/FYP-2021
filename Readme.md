# A Deep Learning Approach To Diagnose Neurological Disorders Using Neuroimaging Data

## Project Description
- A comparative analysis of various deep learning techniques that can be used to model fMRI data and classify an ASD subject. 
- An end-to-end deep learning pipeline to pre-process data, train, test and operationalize the best model.
- A web-based diagnostic tool to showcase how deep learning models can be used in preliminary diagnosis

## Technology used
- The entire application is built using Google Cloud Platform based services
- The enterprise application is built using Flask and React
- The Deep Learning Algorithms are built using Tensorflow and Pytorch-Geometric
- The MLOps is performed using Vertex AI

## Code Description
- backend, frontend and the Dockerfile are for deploying the enterprise application
- notebooks contains the different deep learning experiments that were conducted
- mlops contains the code to operationalize the finalized models
